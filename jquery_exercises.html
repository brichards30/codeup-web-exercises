        <p id="paragraphs-of-nothing">There was something in the tree. It was difficult to tell from the ground, but
            Rachael could see movement.
            She squinted her eyes and peered in the direction of the movement, trying to decipher exactly what she had
            spied. The more she peered, however, the more she thought it might be a figment of her imagination. Nothing
            seemed to move until the moment she began to take her eyes off the tree. Then in the corner of her eye, she
            would see the movement again and begin the process of staring again.</p>
